# Job-OS — Pipeline de Recherche d'Emploi IA

## Origin

This system was built and used by [santifer](https://santifer.io) to evaluate 740+ job offers, generate 100+ tailored CVs, and land a Head of Applied AI role. The archetypes, scoring logic, negotiation scripts, and proof point structure all reflect his specific career search in AI/automation roles.

The portfolio that goes with this system is also open source: [cv-santiago](https://github.com/santifer/cv-santiago).

**It will work out of the box, but it's designed to be made yours.** If the archetypes don't match your career, the modes are in the wrong language, or the scoring doesn't fit your priorities -- just ask. You (AI Agent) can edit the user's files. The user says "change the archetypes to data engineering roles" and you do it. That's the whole point.

## Data Contract (CRITICAL)

There are two layers. Read `DATA_CONTRACT.md` for the full list.

**User Layer (NEVER auto-updated, personalization goes HERE):**
- `cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `modes/_profile.md`, `article-digest.md`, `portals.yml`
- `data/*`, `reports/*`, `output/*`, `interview-prep/*`

**System Layer (auto-updatable, DON'T put user data here):**
- `modes/_shared.md`, `modes/offre.md`, all other modes
- `CLAUDE.md`, `*.mjs` scripts, `dashboard/*`, `templates/*`, `batch/*`

**THE RULE: When the user asks to customize anything (archetypes, narrative, negotiation scripts, proof points, location policy, comp targets), ALWAYS write to `modes/_profile.md` or `config/profile.yml`. NEVER edit `modes/_shared.md` for user-specific content.** This ensures system updates don't overwrite their customizations.

## Update Check

On the first message of each session, run the update checker silently:

```bash
node update-system.mjs check
```

Parse the JSON output:
- `{"status": "update-available", "local": "1.0.0", "remote": "1.1.0", "changelog": "..."}` → tell the user:
  > "job-os update available (v{local} → v{remote}). Your data (CV, profile, tracker, reports) will NOT be touched. Want me to update?"
  If yes → run `node update-system.mjs apply`. If no → run `node update-system.mjs dismiss`.
- `{"status": "up-to-date"}` → say nothing
- `{"status": "dismissed"}` → say nothing
- `{"status": "offline"}` → say nothing

The user can also say "check for updates" or "update job-os" at any time to force a check.
To rollback: `node update-system.mjs rollback`

## What is job-os

AI-powered job search automation built on Claude Code: pipeline tracking, offer evaluation, CV generation, portal scanning, batch processing.

### OpenCode Commands

When using [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), the following slash commands are available (defined in `.opencode/commands/`):

| Command | Claude Code Equivalent | Description |
|---------|------------------------|-------------|
| `/job-os` | `/job-os` | Show menu or evaluate JD with args |
| `/job-os-pipeline` | `/job-os pipeline` | Process pending URLs from inbox |
| `/job-os-evaluate` | `/job-os offre` | Evaluate job offer (A-F scoring) |
| `/job-os-compare` | `/job-os offres` | Compare and rank multiple offers |
| `/job-os-contact` | `/job-os contacto` | LinkedIn outreach (find contacts + draft) |
| `/job-os-deep` | `/job-os deep` | Deep company research |
| `/job-os-pdf` | `/job-os pdf` | Generate ATS-optimized CV |
| `/job-os-training` | `/job-os training` | Evaluate course/cert against goals |
| `/job-os-project` | `/job-os project` | Evaluate portfolio project idea |
| `/job-os-tracker` | `/job-os tracker` | Application status overview |

| `/job-os-followup` | `/job-os followup` | Follow-up cadence tracker |
| `/job-os-setup` | `/job-os setup` | Onboarding wizard: configure tracks, CVs, profile, portals |

**Note:** OpenCode commands invoke the same `.claude/skills/job-os/SKILL.md` skill used by Claude Code. The `modes/*` files are shared between both platforms.

### First Run — Onboarding (IMPORTANT)

**Before doing ANYTHING else, check if the system is set up.** Run these checks silently every time a session starts:

1. Does at least one CV file exist? (`cv.md` or any `cv-*.md`)
2. Does `config/profile.yml` exist (not just profile.example.yml)?
3. Does `modes/_profile.md` exist (not just _profile.template.md)?
4. Does `portals.yml` exist (not just templates/portals.example.yml)?

**If ANY of these is missing, load `modes/setup.md` and run the onboarding wizard.** Do NOT proceed with evaluations, scans, or any other mode until setup is complete. The wizard handles all steps including track selection, CV collection, profile configuration, portal setup, and validation.

**After every evaluation, learn.** If the user says "this score is too high, I wouldn't apply here" or "you missed that I have experience in X", update your understanding in `modes/_profile.md`, `config/profile.yml`, or `article-digest.md`. The system should get smarter with every interaction without putting personalization into system-layer files.

### Personalization

This system is designed to be customized by YOU (AI Agent). When the user asks you to change archetypes, translate modes, adjust scoring, add companies, or modify negotiation scripts -- do it directly. You read the same files you use, so you know exactly what to edit.

**Common customization requests:**
- "Change the archetypes to [backend/frontend/data/devops] roles" → edit `modes/_profile.md` or `config/profile.yml`
- "Translate the modes to English" → edit all files in `modes/`
- "Add these companies to my portals" → edit `portals.yml`
- "Update my profile" → edit `config/profile.yml`
- "Change the CV template design" → edit `templates/cv-template.html`
- "Adjust the scoring weights" → edit `modes/_profile.md` for user-specific weighting, or edit `modes/_shared.md` and `batch/batch-prompt.md` only when changing the shared system defaults for everyone

### Language Modes

**Default language is French.** Unless `config/profile.yml` specifies otherwise, always load `modes/fr/` instead of `modes/`. All evaluations, reports, and wizard output should be in French by default.

Available language packs:

- **Français (défaut) :** `modes/fr/` — traductions natives avec vocabulaire spécifique France/Belgique/Suisse/Luxembourg (CDI/CDD, convention collective SYNTEC, RTT, mutuelle, prévoyance, 13e mois, intéressement/participation, titres-restaurant, CSE, portage salarial, etc.). Inclut `_shared.md`, `offre.md` (évaluation), `postuler.md` (candidature), `pipeline.md`.
- **German (DACH market):** `modes/de/` — native German translations with DACH-specific vocabulary (13. Monatsgehalt, Probezeit, Kündigungsfrist, AGG, Tarifvertrag, etc.). Includes `_shared.md`, `angebot.md` (evaluation), `bewerben.md` (apply), `pipeline.md`.
- **English:** `modes/` — use when the user explicitly requests English or when evaluating English-only roles.
- **Japanese (Japan market):** `modes/ja/` — native Japanese translations with Japan-specific vocabulary (正社員, 業務委託, 賞与, 退職金, みなし残業, 年俸制, 36協定, 通勤手当, 住宅手当, etc.). Includes `_shared.md`, `kyujin.md` (evaluation), `oubo.md` (apply), `pipeline.md`.

**Mode selection logic (in priority order):**
1. `language.modes_dir` set in `config/profile.yml` → always use that language pack
2. User explicitly requests a language ("use English", "passe en allemand") → switch for the session
3. You detect a JD in a specific language → suggest switching, but don't auto-switch
4. No configuration → **default to French** (`modes/fr/`)

**When NOT to use French:** Only if the user explicitly targets English-language roles or asks for English output.

### Skill Modes

| If the user... | Mode |
|----------------|------|
| Pastes JD or URL | auto-pipeline (evaluate + report + PDF + tracker) |
| Asks to evaluate offer | `offre` |
| Asks to compare offers | `offres` |
| Wants LinkedIn outreach | `contacto` |
| Asks for company research | `deep` |
| Preps for interview at specific company | `interview-prep` |
| Wants to generate CV/PDF | `pdf` |
| Evaluates a course/cert | `training` |
| Evaluates portfolio project | `project` |
| Asks about application status | `tracker` |
| Fills out application form | `apply` |
| Searches for new offers | `scan` |
| Processes pending URLs | `pipeline` |
| Batch processes offers | `batch` |
| Asks about rejection patterns or wants to improve targeting | `patterns` |
| Asks about follow-ups or application cadence | `followup` |

### CV Source of Truth

- `cv.md` in project root is the canonical CV
- `article-digest.md` has detailed proof points (optional)
- **NEVER hardcode metrics** -- read them from these files at evaluation time

---

## Ethical Use -- CRITICAL

**This system is designed for quality, not quantity.** The goal is to help the user find and apply to roles where there is a genuine match -- not to spam companies with mass applications.

- **NEVER submit an application without the user reviewing it first.** Fill forms, draft answers, generate PDFs -- but always STOP before clicking Submit/Send/Apply. The user makes the final call.
- **Strongly discourage low-fit applications.** If a score is below 4.0/5, explicitly recommend against applying. The user's time and the recruiter's time are both valuable. Only proceed if the user has a specific reason to override the score.
- **Quality over speed.** A well-targeted application to 5 companies beats a generic blast to 50. Guide the user toward fewer, better applications.
- **Respect recruiters' time.** Every application a human reads costs someone's attention. Only send what's worth reading.

---

## Offer Verification -- MANDATORY

**NEVER trust WebSearch/WebFetch to verify if an offer is still active.** ALWAYS use Playwright:
1. `browser_navigate` to the URL
2. `browser_snapshot` to read content
3. Only footer/navbar without JD = closed. Title + description + Apply = active.

**Exception for batch workers (`claude -p`):** Playwright is not available in headless pipe mode. Use WebFetch as fallback and mark the report header with `**Verification:** unconfirmed (batch mode)`. The user can verify manually later.

---

## CI/CD and Quality

- **GitHub Actions** run on every PR: `test-all.mjs` (63+ checks), auto-labeler (risk-based: 🔴 core-architecture, ⚠️ agent-behavior, 📄 docs), welcome bot for first-time contributors
- **Branch protection** on `main`: status checks must pass before merge. No direct pushes to main (except admin bypass).
- **Dependabot** monitors npm, Go modules, and GitHub Actions for security updates
- **Contributing process**: issue first → discussion → PR with linked issue → CI passes → maintainer review → merge

## Community and Governance

- **Code of Conduct**: Contributor Covenant 2.1 with enforcement actions (see `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`)
- **Governance**: BDFL model with contributor ladder — Participant → Contributor → Triager → Reviewer → Maintainer (see `GOVERNANCE.md`)
- **Security**: private vulnerability reporting via email (see `SECURITY.md`)
- **Support**: help questions go to Discord/Discussions, not issues (see `SUPPORT.md`)
- **Discord**: https://discord.gg/8pRpHETxa4

## Stack and Conventions

- Node.js (mjs modules), Playwright (PDF + scraping), YAML (config), HTML/CSS (template), Markdown (data), Canva MCP (optional visual CV)
- Scripts in `.mjs`, configuration in YAML
- Output in `output/` (gitignored), Reports in `reports/`
- JDs in `jds/` (referenced as `local:jds/{file}` in pipeline.md)
- Batch in `batch/` (gitignored except scripts and prompt)
- Report numbering: sequential 3-digit zero-padded, max existing + 1
- **RULE: After each batch of evaluations, run `node merge-tracker.mjs`** to merge tracker additions and avoid duplications.
- **RULE: NEVER create new entries in applications.md if company+role already exists.** Update the existing entry.

### TSV Format for Tracker Additions

Write one TSV file per evaluation to `batch/tracker-additions/{num}-{company-slug}.tsv`. Single line, 9 tab-separated columns:

```
{num}\t{date}\t{company}\t{role}\t{status}\t{score}/5\t{pdf_emoji}\t[{num}](reports/{num}-{slug}-{date}.md)\t{note}
```

**Column order (IMPORTANT -- status BEFORE score):**
1. `num` -- sequential number (integer)
2. `date` -- YYYY-MM-DD
3. `company` -- short company name
4. `role` -- job title
5. `status` -- canonical status (e.g., `Evaluated`)
6. `score` -- format `X.X/5` (e.g., `4.2/5`)
7. `pdf` -- `✅` or `❌`
8. `report` -- markdown link `[num](reports/...)`
9. `notes` -- one-line summary

**Note:** In applications.md, score comes BEFORE status. The merge script handles this column swap automatically.

### Pipeline Integrity

1. **NEVER edit applications.md to ADD new entries** -- Write TSV in `batch/tracker-additions/` and `merge-tracker.mjs` handles the merge.
2. **YES you can edit applications.md to UPDATE status/notes of existing entries.**
3. All reports MUST include `**URL:**` in the header (between Score and PDF). Include `**Legitimacy:** {tier}` (see Block G in `modes/offre.md`).
4. All statuses MUST be canonical (see `templates/states.yml`).
5. Health check: `node verify-pipeline.mjs`
6. Normalize statuses: `node normalize-statuses.mjs`
7. Dedup: `node dedup-tracker.mjs`

### Canonical States (applications.md)

**Source of truth:** `templates/states.yml`

| State | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `Evaluated` | Report completed, pending decision |
| `Applied` | Application sent |
| `Responded` | Company responded |
| `Interview` | In interview process |
| `Offer` | Offer received |
| `Rejected` | Rejected by company |
| `Discarded` | Discarded by candidate or offer closed |
| `SKIP` | Doesn't fit, don't apply |

**RULES:**
- No markdown bold (`**`) in status field
- No dates in status field (use the date column)
- No extra text (use the notes column)

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **job-os** (545 symbols, 1231 relationships, 36 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/job-os/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | When to use | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Find code by concept | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})` |
| `context` | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})` |
| `impact` | Blast radius before editing | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` |
| `rename` | Safe multi-file rename | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher` | Custom graph queries | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})` |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| d=1 | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these |
| d=2 | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps | Should test |
| d=3 | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/job-os/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/job-os/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/job-os/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/job-os/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:
1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## Keeping the Index Fresh

After committing code changes, the GitNexus index becomes stale. Re-run analyze to update it:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

If the index previously included embeddings, preserve them by adding `--embeddings`:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze --embeddings
```

To check whether embeddings exist, inspect `.gitnexus/meta.json` — the `stats.embeddings` field shows the count (0 means no embeddings). **Running analyze without `--embeddings` will delete any previously generated embeddings.**
