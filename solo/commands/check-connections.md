# /solo:check-connections

## Configure API Keys (if user asks to "setup keys", "add api key", "configure exa", "configure reddit")

Check `.claude/mcp-keys.local.md` for existing keys. For each missing key, ask conversationally:

**Exa (not configured):**
> "Exa gives you neural/semantic search for market research, competitor discovery, and trend analysis. Free tier at exa.ai.
> Do you have an Exa API key? (paste it here, or press Enter to skip)"

**Reddit (not configured):**
> "Reddit research mines unfiltered user pain points and authentic language. Requires a free Reddit developer app (reddit.com/prefs/apps → script type).
> Do you have Reddit API credentials? If yes, paste your Client ID:"
> [then] "And your Client Secret:"

**Chrome extension (not active):**
> "The Claude Chrome extension (claude.com/chrome) lets me browse Reddit and sites directly with no API key needed — good free alternative for Reddit research. Install it and it activates automatically."

Write/update `.claude/mcp-keys.local.md`:
```
---
exa_api_key: <value>
reddit_client_id: <value>
reddit_client_secret: <value>
---

API keys for Cowork plugins. This file is gitignored — never commit it.
Restart Cowork after changes.
```

Ensure `.claude/*.local.md` is in `.gitignore`.

## Agent Instructions

### Step 1: Detect Connected MCP Servers

```python
def detect_connections():
    """Probe for available MCP servers"""
    servers = {
        "filesystem": check_server("filesystem"),
        "exa": check_server("exa"),

        "hubspot": check_server("hubspot"),
        "stripe": check_server("stripe"),
        "figma": check_server("figma"),
        "notion": check_server("notion"),
        "ms365": check_server("ms365"),
        "linkedin": check_server("linkedin"),
        "clay": check_server("clay"),

            "connected": True,
            "latency": result.latency,
            "version": result.version,
            "status": "healthy"
        }
    except ConnectionError:
        return {"connected": False}
```

def load_usage_analytics():
    """Read usage data from memory"""
    analytics_file = "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/data/memoire/usage-analytics.json"
    
    if file_exists(analytics_file):

    # Figma - medium impact if building products
    if not connections.get("figma"):

                "tool": "Tally (~~forms)",
                "impact": "HIGH",
                "reason": f"You've used /solo:diagnose {diagnose_usage} times",

            })
    
    return sorted(recommendations, key=lambda x: x["impact"], reverse=True)

### Step 4: Generate Capability Matrix

```python
def generate_capability_matrix(connections):
    """Show what each tier unlocks"""
    features = [
        {
            "name": "Client Management",

            "with_hubspot": "Live CRM sync",
            "supercharged": "Full automation + insights"
        },
        {
            "name": "Invoicing",
            "offline": "Template filling",
            "basic": "PDF generation",
            "with_stripe": "Auto-send + tracking",
            "supercharged": "Payment reminders + analytics"
        },
        # ... more features
    ]
    
    current_tier = determine_tier(connections)
    return format_matrix(features, current_tier)

def determine_tier(connections):
    """Calculate current capability tier"""
    count = len(connections)
    if count == 0:
        return "OFFLINE"
    elif count <= 2:
        return "BASIC"
    elif count <= 5:
        return "PRO"
    else:
        return "SUPERCHARGED"
```

### Step 5: Format Output

```python
def format_connection_status(connections, recommendations, matrix, usage):
    """Generate the full status report"""
    
    output = f"""

   - Data directory: ./data/
```

### Test All Connections

```bash
/solo:test all

Output:
Running diagnostics on all configured connections...

✅ filesystem - Healthy (12ms)
✅ exa - Healthy (45ms, 85/100 API calls remaining)
❌ hubspot - Not connected
⚠️  slack - Connected but slow (320ms latency)
✅ stripe - Healthy
```

## Integration with Other Commands

This command should be suggested contextually:

```python
# In /solo:clients when no CRM connected
if not has_crm_connection():
    suggest("💡 Tip: Connect HubSpot for automatic client sync. Run /solo:check-connections")

# In /solo:invoice when no payment provider  
if not has_payment_provider():
    suggest("💡 Tip: Connect Stripe to auto-send invoices. Run /solo:check-connections")
```

---

## Privacy & Security

- Connection status is stored locally
