## Tips

1. **Run every Monday** — Make this your Monday morning ritual (15 minutes)
2. **Act on priorities** — The review is only useful if you execute the top 3 priorities
3. **Track trends** — Compare week-over-week to spot patterns
4. **Adjust targets** — If you're consistently hitting 120% of target, raise the target
5. **Celebrate wins** — Note what's working and do more of it
