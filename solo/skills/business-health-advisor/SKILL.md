# Skill: Business Health Advisor

`weekly-review` tells you what happened this week. This skill tells you whether your business is structurally sound. It answers the questions that week-to-week data obscures: Are you growing or just busy? Are you dependent on a client who could leave? Are you working more for less?

Run monthly (recommended: last working day of the month) or on-demand.

## STEP 0 — DATA AVAILABILITY DECLARATION

Before running the analysis, state what can and cannot be calculated:

```
READ data/1-Projets/invoices/*.md → revenue data (6 months)
READ data/1-Projets/clients/*.md → client revenue allocation
READ data/2-Domaines/business-profile.json → income target, capacity target
```

Report:
```
Available for automatic analysis:
  ✓ Dimension 1: Revenue Trend (6 months of invoices found)
  ✓ Dimension 2: Client Concentration (client cards found)
  ✗ Dimension 3: Margin Efficiency — needs: hours worked this month
  ✗ Dimension 4: Capacity Utilization — needs: actual hours worked
  ✗ Dimension 6: Wellbeing — needs: self-assessment

To complete the full analysis, please provide:
  1. How many hours did you work this month?
  2. Wellbeing self-assessment: energy level [1-10], late nights [Y/N], weekend work [Y/N]
```

Wait for this input before running dimensions 3, 4, and 6.


## Six Dimensions of Solo Business Health

### Dimension 1: Revenue Trend

**What it measures:** Direction of growth, not just current level.

**Data source:** `data/1-Projets/invoices/` — paid invoices, last 6 months

**Calculations:**

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| MRR (current) | This month's paid invoices |
| 3-month moving average | (M-1 + M-2 + M-3) / 3 |
| 6-month moving average | (M-1 through M-6) / 6 |
| Month-over-month growth | (Current MRR - Last MRR) / Last MRR |
| Revenue trend | Compare 3M avg to 6M avg |

**Health signals:**

| Signal | Score |
|--------|-------|
| 3M avg > 6M avg + growing each month | 🟢 Growing |
| 3M avg ≈ 6M avg, consistent | 🟡 Stable (not scaling) |
| 3M avg < 6M avg or declining 2+ months | 🔴 Contracting |

---

### Dimension 2: Client Concentration Risk

**What it measures:** How exposed you are if one client leaves.

**Data source:** `data/1-Projets/clients/` — revenue by client, last 6 months

**Calculation:**
```
For each client: [client revenue] / [total revenue] = concentration %
```

**Health thresholds:**

| Concentration | Signal | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| No single client >30% of revenue | 🟢 Diversified | Low |
| One client = 30–50% of revenue | 🟡 Exposed | If they leave, revenue drops materially |
| One client >50% of revenue | 🔴 Dangerous | Single point of failure |
| Two clients >80% of revenue combined | 🔴 Critical | Any disruption is a crisis |

**Output:** Client concentration matrix showing each client's revenue share.

**Recovery prescription for 🔴:**
> "You have a single-client dependency. Even if the relationship is strong, you're one budget cut or one org change away from a revenue crisis. Your immediate priority is to build 2–3 new client relationships to reduce [Client X]'s share below 40% within 90 days."

### Dimension 3: Service Profitability

**What it measures:** Which work makes money per hour worked.

**Data source:**
- Revenue per service type: from invoices, categorized by service
- Hours per service type: from `data/1-Projets/[project]/time-log.md` (if tracked)
- Expense allocation: from `expense-tracker` for subcontractors and service-specific costs

**Calculation (per service type):**
```
Revenue per hour = Service Revenue / Service Hours
Net margin = (Service Revenue - Direct Costs) / Service Revenue
```

**Output table:**

| Service | Revenue | Hours | €/hour | Net Margin | Verdict |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| [Service A] | €[X] | [Y]h | €[Z] | [X%] | 🟢 High margin |
| [Service B] | €[X] | [Y]h | €[Z] | [X%] | 🟡 OK |
| [Service C] | €[X] | [Y]h | €[Z] | [X%] | 🔴 Below target rate |

**When time tracking isn't available:** Use the capacity-planner's project actuals or ask user to estimate.

**Health signal:** Any service generating <75% of your target hourly rate is a candidate for repricing or discontinuation.

---

### Dimension 4: Pipeline Health Trend

**What it measures:** Whether future revenue is being built while delivering current work.

**Data source:** `data/1-Projets/pipeline.md` — weighted pipeline over time

**Metrics:**
- Current weighted pipeline value
- Pipeline coverage ratio: weighted pipeline / monthly revenue target
- New leads added per month (last 3 months)
- Time to close (avg days from lead to signed)

**Health thresholds:**

| Pipeline Coverage | Signal |
|---|---|
| >3× monthly target | 🟢 Strong coverage |
| 1.5–3× monthly target | 🟡 Adequate |
| <1.5× monthly target | 🔴 Thin pipeline — revenue risk in 60–90 days |
| 0 new leads in 30 days | 🔴 Prospecting has stopped |

**The key insight:** Revenue dips always lag pipeline dips by 60–90 days. A weak pipeline today is a cash flow crisis in Q+2.

---

### Dimension 5: Capacity Utilization

**What it measures:** Whether you're optimally loaded — not over, not under.

**Data source:** `capacity-planner` skill output

**Metrics:**
- Billable utilization rate: billable hours / available hours
- Revenue per hour (effective): total revenue / total hours worked
- Overload events: weeks where committed > available (last 3 months)

**Health thresholds:**

| Utilization | Signal |
|---|---|
| 70–85% billable utilization | 🟢 Optimal |
| 85–100% | 🟡 Near capacity — little buffer for new opportunities |
| >100% | 🔴 Overloaded — quality or deadlines at risk |
| <60% | 🟡 Underfull — need more work or a rate increase |
| <40% | 🔴 Underfull — business development emergency |

---

### Dimension 6: Solopreneur Wellbeing Signals

**What it measures:** Early warning indicators for burnout and unsustainable work patterns.

**Data source:** Pattern analysis across project files, weekly reviews, and client data

**Signals scanned:**

| Signal | Detection Method | Risk |
|--------|-----------------|------|
| Same blocker for 4+ weeks in weekly reviews | Scan review notes | Structural problem being ignored |
| No vacation or break in 90+ days | Scan project calendar | Burnout approaching |
| Working evenings/weekends repeatedly | Time log patterns if tracked | Unsustainable pace |
| 0 wins logged in 3+ weekly reviews | Scan review notes | Motivation / morale at risk |
| Increasing overdue items trend | Project/invoice data | Capacity or scope problem |
| Revenue same but hours increasing | Capacity + revenue data | Doing more for less |

**This is the hardest dimension** because the data is qualitative. The advisor presents patterns and asks directly:
> "I've noticed [X] in your recent reviews. How are you actually doing? Is the pace sustainable?"

### Strategic Recommendations Format

Recommendations must be specific — attach numbers, dates, and concrete next steps:

❌ "Diversify your client base"
✓ "Your top client is [X]% of revenue. Adding 2 clients at €[Y]/month each would reduce concentration to [Z]% by [quarter]. Target: [1-2 sectors from ICP where you have case studies]."

❌ "Improve your margins"
✓ "Your effective hourly rate is €[X]. Raising Standard tier by 15% would add €[Y]/month on existing workload. Next proposal: apply new rate to [client type] first."

For each dimension scored 🟡 or 🔴, produce ONE specific action with:
- The number that would move it to 🟢
- The specific first step to get there
- A realistic timeline
